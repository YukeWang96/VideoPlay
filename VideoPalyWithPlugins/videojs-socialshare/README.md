# videojs-socialShare
Adds social sharing buttons to the video widget for Facebook and Twitter.
____

### Purpose
Share your embeded video URL directly from the unit itself. This plugin adds a Facebook and Twitter (more possible) widget to your player to share the page URL without having to scroll to your pageâ€™s own share tools.

### Usage
This plugin requires [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js) and was created with version 5.4.4.

It also uses [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/flexbox).

1. Install [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js)
2. Add the [videojs-socialShare](https://github.com/jmccraw/videojs-socialShare/blob/master/videojs.socialShare.css) CSS to your page
3. Add the [videojs-socialShare](https://github.com/jmccraw/videojs-socialShare/blob/master/videojs.socialShare.js) JavaScript to your page
4. Initialize the plugin with some social sharing information in JSON format
5. Test to see that the social sharing tools appear

### Example
Below is a sample use case. Feel free to add the videojs-socialShare CSS/JS to your own project how you see fit. Separated here as an example.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="videojs-socialShare.css">
<video id="my-video" data-setup="{}" preload="auto" controls">
  <source src="my-video.mp4">
  <source src="my-video.webm">
</video>
<script src="videojs-socialShare.js"></script>
<script>
  'use strict';
  
  var video = videojs('my-video');
  video.socialShare({
    facebook: { // optional, includes a Facebook share button (See the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/reference/share-dialog) for more information)
      shareUrl: '', // optional, defaults to window.location.href
      shareImage: '', // optional, defaults to the Facebook-scraped image
      shareText: ''
    },
    twitter: { // optional, includes a Twitter share button (See the [Twitter documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button/web-intent) for more information)
      handle: '', // optional, appends `via @handle` to the end of the tweet 
      shareUrl: '', // optional, defaults to window.location.href
      shareText: '' 
    }
  });
</script>
```

### Notes
For Facebook to work to the best of its ability, you need to have implemented the Facebook SDK or at least the og metadata, include the `fb:app_id`.

You should also style this to work across viewports, since this is only a cursory example for desktop, although it'll probably work fine on smaller screens. It also doesn't have a fallback for mobile, for example, appearing under or over the video itself, since it appears on hover and mobile devices don't do that.

Let me know if you run into any bugs or recommendations.
